# this is a game

## progress:

[x] - set up the file structure for the character selection process
[x] - finished the character selection process (maybe without some classes/stats that we'd like to add later)
[ ] - begin on non player characters and a basic story idea
[ ] - implement a dialog system
[ ] - implement a combat system
[ ] - potentially figure out more graphic stuff that we can do in the terminal
[ ] - other things i can't think of
